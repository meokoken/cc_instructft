# Gradio Demo 

Gradio is used to create a GUI for our fine-tuned Vicuna 13B model to better see the finetuning results. 

**Prerequisite**: Gradio requires Python 3.8 or higher

## Installing Gradio using pip
```bash
pip install gradio
```

## Demo Jupyter Notebooks

For the sake of comparison, there are two Jupyter notebooks :
1. Vicuna 13B base model 

2. Vicuna 13B base model + LoRA Adapter 

**Disclaimer**: Change the file path of the vicuna base model (model_name) and adapter (adapters_name)
